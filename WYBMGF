Hi baby 😘 it’s been a month since we became official, and I just want to thank you for everything na nangyari satin and for all the memories we’ve made together. 💗 Hindi lang yung mga good ones, pero pati yung mga hard moments. Yung mga night fights, small conflicts, at mga gabing nagpupuyat tayo just to fix things; lahat yun means a lot to me, baby. 🥺💞 I think those moments are what really help us grow in this relationship.

Both of us have been hurt so many times before, even pa nung mga bata pa tayo 😅 pero I feel like na-exp natin lahat yun now para mas matutunan natin kung paano alagaan at intindihin yung each other heehheh 😆💗 Parang yun yung mga bagay na kinulang tayo noon, pero slowly natututunan na natin ngayon. Hehehehehe 🤭✨

Medyo lumalayo na ata ako sa point 😅 pero want ko lang talagang sabihin na I appreciate you babyyy 😘💗 For everything you’ve done, for staying, for trying, and for choosing me every single day. I’m hoping for many more days na makasama pa kita and more experiences na ma-build natin together. 💞🌙

It’s been a month na tayo, pero I still want to ask—can you spend more time with me, baby? 🥺💗 Was I a good boyfriend naman ba? I’d really like to know, kasi syempre I want to keep you safe, happy, and loved. Hehehe 😚💕

I love you, baby. Please stay with me, ha? ♥🥺💗

Hi baby, I just want to start by saying thank you for existing hehe, first and foremost. I'm not entirely sure, but this time around, I wanted to keep this short and sweet while still making it as impactful as I can, just to make things clearer cus I don't want to leave you confused.

I know our romance started in an odd way, but I think you don’t really need an explanation, right? XD I think that’s part of why I’m amazed by it hesterically like sm. We didn’t expect things to turn out this way, but I still think it suits us. Misfits from society have their own way, even in dating — at least, that’s what I want to believe XD. I come with tons of loose screws in my head, so I don’t like scripted or normal things. I refuse to believe that everything is fated and predetermined, and I’d like that for both of us, too.

On this path, even with all the risks, sadness, hardships, trials, and all the negative things we may encounter, I know things will be hard—especially with our setup and everything—but I’d still like to try, as long as it’s with you. I believe we can rewrite our fate together.

I love you, baby Raran, Nizza :(( Nea :((. Can I ask you to be my girlfriend, like for real-real? Despite all the risks that will come along the way, can we try?
