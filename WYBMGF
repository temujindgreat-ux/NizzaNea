Hi baby, I just want to start by saying thank you for existing hehe, first and foremost. I'm not entirely sure, but this time around, I wanted to keep this short and sweet while still making it as impactful as I can, just to make things clearer cus I don't want to leave you confused.

I know our romance started in an odd way, but I think you don’t really need an explanation, right? XD I think that’s part of why I’m amazed by it hesterically like sm. We didn’t expect things to turn out this way, but I still think it suits us. Misfits from society have their own way, even in dating — at least, that’s what I want to believe XD. I come with tons of loose screws in my head, so I don’t like scripted or normal things. I refuse to believe that everything is fated and predetermined, and I’d like that for both of us, too.

On this path, even with all the risks, sadness, hardships, trials, and all the negative things we may encounter, I know things will be hard—especially with our setup and everything—but I’d still like to try, as long as it’s with you. I believe we can rewrite our fate together.

I love you, baby Raran, Nizza :(( Nea :((. Can I ask you to be my girlfriend, like for real-real? Despite all the risks that will come along the way, can we try?
